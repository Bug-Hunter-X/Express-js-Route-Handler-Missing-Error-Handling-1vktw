# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, this example shows a route that retrieves a user by ID, but doesn't handle the case where the ID is invalid.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains the faulty Express.js route handler.  It attempts to retrieve a user based on an ID from the URL parameters, but lacks error handling for cases where the ID is invalid or not found.  This could result in an application crash or unexpected behavior such as unhandled exceptions.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the handler that incorporates error handling. It checks if the user exists; if not, it returns a 404 error response; otherwise, it proceeds with normal execution.   This robust approach prevents crashes and provides a more user-friendly experience by returning meaningful error responses.
